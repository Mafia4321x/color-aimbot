[Always Updated] Color aimbot razer mouse injector coded in python

[Always updated]

This color aimbot takes advantage of the razer synapse dll used to control the mouse inside the default macro tab

This is able to take as many RGB color inputs as you want on the screen and lock on to the color while shooting and following around the moving target in-game

Requirements:
144hz monitor and decent cpu, color aimbots rely on good hardware
Razer mouse that is able to save macros directly to the chip inside the mouse
VSCODE running in admin with python installed
This could work in Valorant for 2 secs before you get banned (find a way to be undetected)

even though this is a good aimbot, it is detected in most games, so use at your own risk

does not work in bodycam due to weird camera system

Features:
Tolerance adjustment
dynamic search radius
system integrated screen capture and razer mouse control
RGB color input
adjust the framerate, (tested at 900 fps)

My pc hardware:
amd ryzen 7 7700x 8 core 16 thread
RX 7900 xtx 24gb
32gb ddr5 5200mhz
4k 160hz LG freesync premium pro monitor (G-sync)
Razer basilisk v3 pro (wireless)

Run main.py first and wait for server listening before starting aimbot.py!

Look around the code if you want to make some adjustments

This program is multi-threaded and includes a green circle overlay around the mouse cursor which can be toggled with mouse button 5 (changeable)

Credits to 0736b (Thanawat) on github for helping to create the razer injector

known issues:
you need to delete _pycache files before starting the server again (it may take 2 tries to first start working)

Please if you have any suggestions, dont be afraid to reply.
